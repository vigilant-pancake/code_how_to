# Code How To
Examples and content from the Code How To youtube channel

# Introduction

Welcome to the Code How To github, this is a file sharing platform ideal for different types of coding and formats. as the videos and lessons progress through the channed this is where any examples and projects will have their files housed (both incomplete and complete versions of the files will exist for all examples to give a basic framework as well as a fully functional file.

As we progress through the different videos the comments will guide how the future lessons will go as I hope to take into account what the viewers would like to better understand.

# Languages
To start we will cover 3 languages:
- HTML (including javascript and CSS for formatting and function)
- Python
- R

  ## HTML
  Going over HTML the videos will walk you through building a sinple webpage, this will form the base of the channels designed information site, as the html series progresses the website will become more designed and include more information about all information covered on the channel

  ## Python and R
  The python and R instruction videos will focus on the basics of python at first with some basic structure and over all style rules when writing which will build the foundation for later videos which will cover more complex topics
